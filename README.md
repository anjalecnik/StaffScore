<br/><br/>

## Known Issues/Problems üêõ
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Certain UI components need optimization for smaller screens.
- **Dashboard UI**: The dashboard UI is not correctly responsive on large screens (only looks good on laptop size).
- **Filtering**: Filtering tables can only be used after sorting has been selected.
- **Search Functionality**: Case-insensitive search and substring search are not available due to Firebase limitations.
- **Form validation**: The form remains in a dirty state even after values are cleared, causing the submit button to remain enabled due to React Admin's behavior.
